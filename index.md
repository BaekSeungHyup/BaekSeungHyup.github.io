## About Me

I'm SeungHyup Baek, an M.S. student in the Department of Artificial Inteligence at Konkuk University, advised by [Prof. Jae Won Cho](https://chojw.github.io/) in the Multimodal AI Laboratory (MMAI).

My research interests center on video-language models, particularly dense video captioning and video temporal grounding. My prior work includes investigating task interference issues in dense video captioning models, aiming to improve their multi-task alignment and overall performance.

Recently, my research has expanded toward object-centric video prediction, with a focus on understanding object interactions under multi-view and dynamic-view settings. I am particularly interested in developing robust perception models that can generalize across real-world visual dynamics.
